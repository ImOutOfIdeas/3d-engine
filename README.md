The story so far...

I'm trying to learn to write shaders. So I thought, why not make that as hard
as possible. Using C and the SOKOL libraries I have created a spining obama
prism. From here I will atempt to create more complex 3d scenes and graphics.

A.K.A...
I have no plan and don't know what I'm doing.
